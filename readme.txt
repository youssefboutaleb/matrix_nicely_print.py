in this program the idea is to use the method string.rjust(length, character)[method will right align the string, using a specified character [space is default] as the fill character]
for each element .
and for the length we should chose a length >= the length of the biggest number.
in our case ,we chose length=the length of the biggest number => str(M[i][j]).rjust(x) for each element
